        <p>During my free time, I tend to take long walks on the beach singing my favorite song<br>
           by <strong>Venessa Carlton "A Thousand Miles"</strong> which I am a huge fan of. While<br>
           singing to this amazing piece of work. I always do my favorite dance to this song<br>
           just like the animated gif you see below.</p>

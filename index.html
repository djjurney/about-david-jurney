        <h1>About David Jurney</h1>
        <h2>AkA The Man, The Myth, The Legend</h2>

        <p>There's not to many words that can describe the incredible person that I am.<br>
           If there were any words that can describe me, I would say that I am the most<br>
           Super-Incrediblest person you will ever get to meet. During my free time,<br>
           I tend to take long walks on the beach singing my favorite song by, Venessa<br>
           Carlton, "A Thousand Miles", which I am a huge fan of.</p>

        <p>While singing to this amazing piece of work. I always do my favorite<br>
           dance to this song, just like the animated gif you see below.</p>

        <p>Other than that I am happy to be here in this course with you all, and look<br>
           forward into collaborating and getting to know you all. Thanks.</p>
